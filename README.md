# Mathias Madsen — ACD-E25 Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio documents four computational design studies developed for Advanced Computational Design. Across the series, I investigate <theme> through <methods/tools>, iterating through prototypes, parameter sweeps, and visual evaluation.

## Assignments

### A1: NumPy Array Manipulation for 2D Pattern Generation
In A1, I develop a pixel-based pattern generator using NumPy array operations to transform a blank canvas into structured, colorized images. The work focuses on compositional logic (rules + constraints) and controlled randomness to produce a family of variations.

### A2: Exploring Fractals through Recursive Geometric Patterns
In A2, I build a recursive geometric system to explore branching and fractal-like growth. I test how parameter choices (e.g., depth, angle, scaling, and spatial influences) affect density, hierarchy, and legibility of the resulting forms.

### A3: Parametric Structural Canopy
In A3, I design a canopy system driven by a heightmap/field and implemented in Grasshopper/GhPython. I evaluate panelization/tessellation strategies and generate a structural support logic that responds to curvature, span, and local conditions.

### A4: Agent-Based Modeling for Surface Panelization
In A4, I use agent behaviors to sample and rationalize a surface into a panelized system. I define sensing rules and constraints (e.g., proximity, alignment, boundaries) and iterate on behaviors to balance local decisions with global coherence.
